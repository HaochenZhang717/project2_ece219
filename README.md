This repo contains the code and results for project 2 for ECE 219 Winter 2024. 

Code is separated into four parts:

Question 1~ 9 

Question 10~17

Question 19~25

Question 26~28

You can check all codes in four ipynb files.

To run the code, just open ipynb files and run them will be okay.

Note that the last figure can not be displayed in the ipynb file, so we include it as a spearate file called the_last_file.jpg
