This repo contains the code and results for project 2 for ECE 219 Winter 2024. 

Code is separated into four parts:

Question 1~ 9 

Question 10~17

Question 19~25

Question 26~28

You can check all codes in four ipynb files.

To run the code, just open ipynb files and run them.

Note that the last figure can not be displayed in the ipynb file, so we include it as a spearate file called the_last_file.jpg

The provided code in the "Q26_28" file utilizes Google Colab to mount Google Drive and access files stored there. It mounts Google Drive at the path '/content/drive' and sets the CSV file path to '/content/drive/MyDrive/219/Pokemon.csv'. Additionally, the dataset is imported in "in[4]". The images are downloaded from the Kaggle dataset "Pokemon Image Dataset" (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hlrhegemony/pokemon-image-dataset?resource=download), and the Pokemon.csv file is downloaded from GitHub (https://github.com/lgreski/pokemonData/blob/master/Pokemon.csv).
